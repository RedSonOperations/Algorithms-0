# Algorithms-0

Various algorithms and some projects written in Java. High concentration of algorithms and extensive use of data structures for optimal time complexity performance such as Huffman Tree encoding/decoding with a priority queue, 
Quicksort and Merge Sort Variations by pivot and Insertion Sort utility, prefix to postfix converter using stacks, and graphs/trees. 
Leverages custom-written data structure implementations rather than imports.
